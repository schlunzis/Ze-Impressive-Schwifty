# Ze-Impressive-Schwifty

Ze-Impressive-Schwifty is a collection of handcrafted utility functions that are designed for custom projects. Still they 
are created in a manner that allows them to be used in a wider context.

## Usage

The modules are published on maven central. To use them add the dependency to your project. For example to add the
`zis-commons` module add the following block:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.schlunzis.zis</groupId>
    <artifactId>zis-commons</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1</version>
<dependency>
```
## Example projects


The following lists shows projects that use the `Ze-Impressive-Schwifty` modules and can be used as examples: 
- [Polynomial-Regression](https://github.com/JayPi4c/Polynomial-regression)
- [Neuro-Evolution-Vehicles](https://github.com/theBrainsGD/NeuroEvolutionVehicles)

(The examples use the code provided by the `Ze-Impressive-Schwifty` modules. They may not already use the maven 
dependencies from maven central. This is about to change soonish...)
